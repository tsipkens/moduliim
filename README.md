This code provides **modu**lar TiRe-**LII** **m**odelling tools in Python to interpret signals. Models are set up to take a range of properties as inputs, enabling rapid changes to optimization routines and uncertainty quantification including nuisance parameters.

Focus is placed on heat transfer modelling.
